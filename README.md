# LFX Forum Software

A simple Hacker News-like forum powered by SQLite.

## Setup

Create a `.env` file with the following content:

```env
DATABASE="./forum.db"
JWT_SECRET="your_secret"
SITE_TITLE="Your Forum Name"
POSTS_PER_PAGE="20"
THEME="Sunset Glow"
BAN_TIMEOUT="20"
```

### Customize Favicon

To use a custom favicon, replace the `favicon.webp` file in the `static` folder and rebuild the application.

### Deployment

All server files are embedded in the application, allowing you to copy the binary directly to your server.

## Spam Filtering

By default, posts, comments, and usernames containing words from [Google's Profanity Words List](https://github.com/coffee-and-fun/google-profanity-words/blob/main/data/en.txt) are rejected.

You can configure the ban duration using the `BAN_TIMEOUT` variable in the `.env` file (value in minutes).
